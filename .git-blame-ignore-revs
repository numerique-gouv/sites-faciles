# Git blame ignore revs
#
# This file lists commits that should be ignored by `git blame`.
# These are typically bulk formatting or refactoring commits that don't
# carry meaningful authorship information and would pollute blame output.
#
# Usage:
#   git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs <file>
#
# To configure git to use this file automatically:
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# See docs/git-blame-ignore-revs.md for more details.
#
# Format: one full commit SHA per line, with optional comments.

# Example (replace with real commit SHAs when adding formatting commits):
# abc1234def5678abc1234def5678abc1234def5678  # Apply black formatting (2024-01-01)
